Outputs tweets from any Twitter users, hashtag or keyword through the Widget interface. Can be called via shortcode or PHP function call and supports i18n for multiple languages


== Description ==

ThinkTwit is a highly customisable plugin that can output tweets from multiple users (something that very few other plugins can do successfully), #hashtag or keyword. It uses the Twitter Search JSON API v1.1 to access tweets which can be cached. It is very simple, yet flexible and easily customised. It can be placed on your Wordpress page simply through drag and drop on the Widgets interface or through the use of Shortcode or Output Anywhere (PHP function call). Updated regularly and now supports i18n!

**Support:** http://www.thepicketts.org/thinktwit/ or on Twitter **@stephenpickett**

Features:
--------
 * Can be configured from Widgets settings (if displayed in sidebar)
 * Can be implemented using shortcode or Output Anywhere (PHP function call)
 * Contains default slimline CSS for integrated look and feel (can be turned off)
 * Easy to configure and customise (through settings and CSS)
 * Multiple instances can be deployed (like other widgets/plugins)
 * JavaScript is not required (unless no-caching is activated)
 * Can specify multiple usernames
 * Tweets can be filtered by #hashtag or keyword
 * You can select to filter between an AND or OR filter to either show tweets only containing specified usernames and hashtags or any of them
 * Can specify maximum number of tweets to display
 * Can specify maximum number of days back to display
 * Supports no-caching, to prevent caching of tweets by caching engines such as WP Super Cache
 * Supports CURL as an alternative to access the Twitter API if URL file-access is disabled
 * Supports optional caching of tweets and avatars
 * Cache can be manually cleared and will automatically update if the cache is empty
 * Can display the avatar of the Twitter user
 * Output can be filtered (using apply_filters)
 * Can optionally output "Follow @username" links
 * Automated cleanup process that runs periodically according to user setting
 * Internationalised using i18n meaning that if it isn't in your language it's easy to translate! See Other Notes for more details
 * Gracefully deals with Twitter errors and adds them to the PHP error log
 
Requirements/Restrictions:
-------------------------
 * Works with Wordpress 2.8.6 to 4.1, not tested with other versions
 * Can be installed using the widgets sidebar
 * Can also be used via shortcode or Output Anywhere (PHP function call)
 * Uses Twitter REST API v1.1 Application-only authentication and therefore requires an application key (see installation)
 
I am looking for more people to translate ThinkTwit in to other languages, if you are interested please see "Internationalisation (i18n)" 
under "Other Notes".

== Uninstall ==

To uninstall simply deactivate and then delete through the Plugins admin interface. All options and files will be automatically removed.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How many tweets will be shown? =

This is determined by your settings within the widget or your custom call. The default is set to 5.

= How long back will tweets be shown for? =

If using the update frequency "Live (uncached)" ThinkTwit will show tweets that have occurred as far back as "max days" (up to the last 7 
days, due to restrictions in the Twitter API). However, any other option will utilise ThinkTwit's own cache and will therefore display anything 
within the cache (up to "max days"). The exception to this is when the "Paused" option is selected - this will retain tweets (and display those 
tweets) indefinitely (until the update frequency is changed from "Paused").

= What will happen if I haven't tweeted in the last 7 days? =

If you aren't caching tweets then a message will be shown stating: "There have been no tweets for the past 7 days", but if you are caching 
tweets then it will simply show the tweets stored in the cache, even if they are older than 7 days. This message can be customised within the
settings.

= How can I style ThinkTwit? =

ThinkTwit uses the widget API so should be styled correctly by your theme. It has some default CSS but you may, however, wish to turn this
off (in the ThinkTwit Settings) and add your own. If so you should find the following information handy:

* ThinkTwit essentially outputs tweets as a list
* The list container can be accessed using `ol.thinkTwitTweets`
* All tweets can be accessed using `ol.thinkTwitTweets li.thinkTwitTweet`
* Individual tweets can be accessed using `ol.thinkTwitTweets #tweet-n` where n is the number of the tweet
* Odd and even tweets can be accessed using `ol.thinkTwitTweets li.thinkTwitOdd` and `ol.thinkTwitTweets li.thinkTwitEven` accordingly
* The author within a tweet can be accessed using `ol.thinkTwitTweets li.thinkTwitTweet a.thinkTwitAuthor`
* The author suffix within a tweet can be accessed using `ol.thinkTwitTweets li.thinkTwitTweet a.thinkTwitSuffix`
* The content of a tweet can be accessed using `ol.thinkTwitTweets li.thinkTwitTweet a.thinkTwitContent`
* The published time within a tweet can be accessed using `ol.thinkTwitTweets li.thinkTwitTweet span.thinkTwitPublished`
* The "no tweets" message can be accessed using `ol.thinkTwitTweets li.thinkTwitNoTweets`
* The AJAX error message ("Error: Unable to display tweets") can be accessed using `p.thinkTwitError'

NOTE: Be sure to use the id to access each style in order to over-write the default CSS.

= How do I stop caching in caching engines such as WP Super Cache? =

Turn on no-caching in the widget settings.

= How does no-caching work? =

Instead of outputting HTML it outputs Javascript. The Javascript uses AJAX (via jQuery) to make a call to a method that returns the 
HTML which is then inserted in to the correct location.

= I'm using no-caching but nothing appears below the title =

Your theme is probably not setup properly. AJAX requires a location to insert the returned data from the server-side call. ThinkTwit
puts it in to the div that contains the widget. A Wordpress theme written correctly should output a unique id for each widget that is
output. Inform the developer of your theme to have the following (or something similar) in their register_sidebar function:

`'before_widget' => '<div id="%1$s" class="widget %2$s">'`

= Why do I get this error? Warning: file_get_contents() [function.file-get-contents]: URL file-access is disabled in the server configuration =

You are getting this error because the allow_url_fopen option is disabled on your server. You can resolve this by either enabling it, or
if you are unable to do this (it may be a shared server) you can enable CURL in the widget options.

= I'm getting strange errors or no output =

You may need to clear and rebuild your cache - please use the Clear Cache button within Settings -> ThinkTwit in the Admin area, and then reload 
the page containing ThinkTwit. Otherwise please re-install - see [uninstall instructions](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/thinktwit/uninstallation/ "Uninstall ThinkTwit").

= How do I prevent use of nofollow tags in my URLs? =

You can apply a filter - see the following URL for an example:

http://digwp.com/2010/02/remove-nofollow-attributes-from-post-content/

= What are the options "Show when published" and "Update frequency"? =

* Show when published - indicates whether the time the tweet was made is shown e.g. "This happened 1 day ago"
* Update frequency - indicates how often Twitter should be contacted to get a list of tweets. Use this
to turn on or off caching, and to decide how often to update the cache

= Why aren't my avatar images showing? =

The `images` folder may not exist or it may not be writeable (this folder is required for caching avatars). You must create the directory if it
doesn't already exist or you must chmod it to 755 or higher so that the web server can write to the folder (depends on your web server 
permissions).

= How often do avatars get updated? =

Once every 24 hours (assuming a request is made in this period). This value is not currently configurable.

= Why do I constantly see the message "There have been no recent tweets"? =

It is likely that you have not entered your Twitter API credentials. Please see the Installation tab for more details and check your PHP
error log for any errors (such as incorrect authentication or rate limiting with Twitter).

= Where can I see ThinkTwit errors? =
You can look in the normal error log for your PHP setup. By default this is the error_log file within the root server of your Wordpress
installation but this may differ for each installation so if you are unsure please ask your server administrator.

= Why do I keep seeing the following error "ThinkTwit error: Twitter responded with an unexpected error - [message=Rate limit exceeded, code=88]"? =
This means that you are making too many requests to Twitter. If you are not using caching you should turn this on, and if you are already using it then
you should decrease the frequency that requests are made e.g. change update frequency from "Live (cached)" to "Hourly".

within settings and sorted methods in to alphabetical order to aid searching of methods

= 1.1.6 =
- (13 May 2011) Fixed caching to prevent over-writing of cache and ensure it instead adds them to it (removing anything at the end if 
necessary) and added live option that uses the cache (so you can check for updates and update the cache before displaying cached tweets, 
this ensures that if Twitter is not available it will still display tweets)
