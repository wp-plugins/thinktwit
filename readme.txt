Outputs tweets from any Twitter users, hashtag or keyword through the Widget interface. Can be called via shortcode or PHP function call and supports i18n for multiple languages


== Description ==

ThinkTwit is a highly customisable plugin that can output tweets from multiple users (something that very few other plugins can do successfully), #hashtag or keyword. It uses the Twitter Search JSON API v1.1 to access tweets which can be cached. It is very simple, yet flexible and easily customised. It can be placed on your Wordpress page simply through drag and drop on the Widgets interface or through the use of Shortcode or Output Anywhere (PHP function call). Updated regularly and now supports i18n!

**Support:** http://www.thepicketts.org/thinktwit/ or on Twitter **@stephenpickett**

Features:
--------
 * Can be configured from Widgets settings (if displayed in sidebar)
 * Can be implemented using shortcode or Output Anywhere (PHP function call)
 * Contains default slimline CSS for integrated look and feel
 * Easy to configure and customise (through settings and CSS)
 * Multiple instances can be deployed (like other widgets/plugins)
 * JavaScript is not required (unless no-caching is activated)
 * Can specify multiple usernames
 * Tweets can be filtered by #hashtag or keyword
 * Can specify maximum number of tweets
 * Can specify maximum number of days back to display
 * Supports no-caching, to prevent caching of tweets by caching engines such as WP Super Cache
 * Supports CURL as an alternative to access the Twitter API if URL file-access is disabled
 * Supports optional caching of tweets and avatars
 * Can display the avatar of the Twitter user
 * Output can be filtered (using apply_filters)
 * Can optionally output "Follow @username" links
 * Automated cleanup process that runs periodically according to user setting
 * Internationalised using i18n meaning that if it isn't in your language it's easy to translate! See Other Notes for more details.
 
Requirements/Restrictions:
-------------------------
 * Works with Wordpress 2.8.6 to 3.7.1, not tested with other versions
 * Can be installed using the widgets sidebar
 * Can also be used via shortcode or Output Anywhere (PHP function call)

== Uninstall ==
  ------------------------------------
To uninstall simply deactivate and then delete through the Plugins admin interface. All options and files will be automatically removed.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How many tweets will be shown? =

This is determined by your settings within the widget or your custom call. The default is set to 5.

= How long back will tweets be shown for? =

If using the update frequency "Live (uncached)" ThinkTwit will show tweets that have occurred as far back as "max days" (up to the last 7 
days, due to restrictions in the Twitter API). However, any other option will utilise ThinkTwit's own cache and will therefore display anything 
within the cache (up to "max days").

= What will happen if I haven't tweeted in the last 7 days? =

If you aren't caching tweets then a message will be shown stating: "There have been no tweets for the past 7 days", but if you are caching 
tweets then it will simply show the tweets stored in the cache, even if they are older than 7 days. This message can be customised within the
settings.

= How can I style ThinkTwit? =

ThinkTwit uses the widget API so should be styled correctly by your theme. It has some default CSS but you may, however, wish to turn this
off (in the ThinkTwit Settings) and add your own. If so you should find the following information handy:

* ThinkTwit essentially outputs tweets as a list
* The list container can be accessed using `ol.thinkTwitTweets`
* All tweets can be accessed using `ol.thinkTwitTweets li.thinkTwitTweet`
* Individual tweets can be accessed using `ol.thinkTwitTweets #tweet-n` where n is the number of the tweet
* Odd and even tweets can be accessed using `ol.thinkTwitTweets li.thinkTwitOdd` and `ol.thinkTwitTweets li.thinkTwitEven` accordingly
* The author within a tweet can be accessed using `ol.thinkTwitTweets li.thinkTwitTweet a.thinkTwitAuthor`
* The author suffix within a tweet can be accessed using `ol.thinkTwitTweets li.thinkTwitTweet a.thinkTwitSuffix`
* The content of a tweet can be accessed using `ol.thinkTwitTweets li.thinkTwitTweet a.thinkTwitContent`
* The published time within a tweet can be accessed using `ol.thinkTwitTweets li.thinkTwitTweet span.thinkTwitPublished`
* The "no tweets" message can be accessed using `ol.thinkTwitTweets li.thinkTwitNoTweets`
* The AJAX error message ("Error: Unable to display tweets") can be accessed using `p.thinkTwitError'

NOTE: Be sure to use the id to access each style in order to over-write the default CSS.

= How do I stop caching in caching engines such as WP Super Cache? =

Turn on no-caching in the widget settings.

= How does no-caching work? =

Instead of outputting HTML it outputs Javascript. The Javascript uses AJAX (via jQuery) to make a call to a method that returns the 
HTML which is then inserted in to the correct location.

= I'm using no-caching but nothing appears below the title =

Your theme is probably not setup properly. AJAX requires a location to insert the returned data from the server-side call. ThinkTwit
puts it in to the div that contains the widget. A Wordpress theme written correctly should output a unique id for each widget that is
output. Inform the developer of your theme to have the following (or something similar) in their register_sidebar function:

`'before_widget' => '<div id="%1$s" class="widget %2$s">'`

= Why do I get this error? Warning: file_get_contents() [function.file-get-contents]: URL file-access is disabled in the server configuration =

You are getting this error because the allow_url_fopen option is disabled on your server. You can resolve this by either enabling it, or
if you are unable to do this (it may be a shared server) you can enable CURL in the widget options.

= I'm getting strange errors or no output =

You may need to clear and rebuild your cache. See [uninstall instructions](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/thinktwit/uninstallation/ "Uninstall ThinkTwit").

= How do I prevent use of nofollow tags in my URLs? =

You can apply a filter - see the following URL for an example:

http://digwp.com/2010/02/remove-nofollow-attributes-from-post-content/

= What are the options "Show when published" and "Update frequency"? =

* Show when published - indicates whether the time the tweet was made is shown e.g. "This happened 1 day ago"
* Update frequency - indicates how often Twitter should be contacted to get a list of tweets. Use this
to turn on or off caching, and to decide how often to update the cache

= Why aren't my avatar images showing? =

The `images` folder may not exist or it may not be writeable (this folder is required for caching avatars). You must create the directory if it
doesn't already exist or you must chmod it to 755 or higher so that the web server can write to the folder (depends on your web server 
permissions).

= How often do avatars get updated? =

Once every 24 hours (assuming a request is made in this period). This value is not currently configurable.

= Why do I constantly see the message "There have been no recent tweets"? =

It is likely that you have not entered your Twitter API credentials. Please see the Installation tab for more details.

- (29 Mar 2014) Big improvements to debugging: amended debug output to add the frequency of updates and use of no caching, put the messages in 
order of how they appear in the widget menu, now output actual menu options names and values rather than system values, and added formatting to 
aid identifying option names. Additionally, removed a potential security vulnerability that could allow an unauthorised user to write to the 
images folder and added a setting to allow the default style sheet to be turned off

= 1.5.1 =
- (09 Feb 2014) A user of another plugin (AI Twitter Feeds) that had borrowed the follow button code reported an issue that was a result of
an update to the follow button script from Twitter. This basic update simply updates the script so you should no longer get the following
error: "Uncaught ReferenceError: twttr is not defined"

= 1.5.0 =
- (25 Nov 2013) Fixed an issue preventing hashtags from working properly and added i18n internationalisation support, with Spanish the first

and re-instated an updated version of the old avatar deletion code which runs periodically and takes account of tweets added from chosen 
hashtags

= 1.4.3 =
- (19 Oct 2013) Updated the readme.txt, and both shortcode and Output Anywhere as there were some inconsistencies in naming but also some of

useful/interesting, fixed failure to limit number of tweets by specified value when showing live updates and fixed the follow button not loading
when using no-caching

= 1.4.0 =
- (25 May 2013) Updated to use Twitter REST API v1.1 - please note that after 11th June 2013 any version of ThinkTwit below 1.4.0 WILL NOT WORK

read these before upgrading/installing!

= 1.3.11 =
- (30 Mar 2013) Modified "Live (uncached)" mode to clear out the cache so that it can be used to refresh your cache and fixed display of 
hashtags that was causing a search error in Twitter (if you are caching tweets please set to uncached to clear out the incorrect tweets and 
then you can start caching again)

= 1.3.10 =
- (14 Oct 2012) Altered the way ThinkTwit downloads avatars so that it now uses the profile image URL from the JSON output, added a check to 
ensure that tweets were actually returned from Twitter and made a change to prevent output of Follow script if Show follow links is no
